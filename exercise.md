**Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs)** are a type of artificial intelligence model, developed by pairing opposing neural networks that can extract and represent complex features of images. 

**Generator** and the **Discriminator** are the opposing networks here, where adversarial training is the vital principle in generation of counterfeit images. 

The **Generator** is a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) designed to generate artificial audio, image and video samples that are indistinguishable from the original samples. 

The **Discriminator** determines the authentication of the image generated by the generator.

GANs employ an unsupervised learning setup with a loss function in the form of the discriminator's feedback. This allows the generator to generate realistic images without requiring explicitly labeled data; nonetheless GANs cannot be categorized as unsupervised learning, as the discriminator acts as a supervisor by continuously providing feedback to the generator, guiding it to craft images that resemble the original.

## Diving into the process of Image Generation with GANs

* A random noise vector (often distributed as Uniform or Gaussian) is given as input to the generator that manifests into mimic of the original image post several layers of computation. 

* Discriminator analyses both the original (from training data) and counterfeit image (image received from generator) and calculates the gradient (loss) and directs it to the generator for further training.
  
* The discriminator's output, often referred to as the "predicted label", signifies its probability assessment of whether an input image is original or fake. Predicted label is a continuous value ranging between 0 and 1. A value around 1, indicates the input image is highly likely to be real and fake if the label is closer to 0.

## Learning Process

* The gradient signal information is back propagated to the generator which helps it adjust its **hyperparameters** (learning rate, weights, bias, activation functions, loss function etc.) in the direction of minimizing the error, eventually realizing the original.
  
* This iterative adversarial training procedure updates the weights and biases of both the networks and substantially enhances the network.
  
* The generator masters in deception and the discriminator in identifying the counterfeit image.

* This learning process continues until the generator becomes better at generating images that are indistinguishable from real ones 

## Implementation of GANs

Basic libraries used for generating GAN architecture in python are ** tensor flow and keras **. A simple adversarial generator and discriminator model architecture is explored.

The generator consists of three dense layers wherein the output dense layer has the activation function **tanh** which produces 28X28 (784) dimensional vector for every image input within a normalized range of [-1,1].  This vector is forwarded to the discriminator which flattens the 28X28 vector. The activation functions, **Rectifier Linear Unit (ReLU)** is used for faster convergence of the generator/ discriminator models and **Sigmoid** is used for depicting the originality of the image.

Furthermore, the discriminator and generator are paired and adversarial training of both the models is implemented and the hyperparameters are updated according to the learning environment.

## The most prominent limitations of GANs,
 
**Mode collapse:** Generator fails to completely learn the distribution of the sample data and generates samples that lack diversity- **Generator overfitting**

**Vanishing Gradient:** Occurs when almost negligible gradient is back propagated by the discriminator to the generator hampering the updation of hyperparameters, slowing down the learning process- **Discriminator overfitting**


### Ethical Concerns
* The Deepfake video and audio of people is predominantly used in the entertainment industry but has witnessed alarming concerns like fraud and harm individuals on a global scale
* GANs have been widely used for mimicking the literature developed by humans indirectly violating the Intellectual Property Rights (IPR)
* The generated output can be prejudiced if the training data is not sensitized

## Different types of GAN models and their applications in Image Generation




## Conclusion

Over the past decade GAN models have been constantly evolving making them suitable for a plethora of computing applications. Higher quality of the training data and learning the model for a longer duration ensure that the generated data outperforms the original. Furthermore, imposing ethical guidelines and eliminating sensitive data can help mitigate the ethical concerns to a major extent.
