## Assessment

##### The core objective of generator in GAN is?
* To differentiate real and counterfeit images
* To generate counterfeit images that mimic training data
* To minimize the gradient
* To categorize real and counterfeit images

##### Discriminator is majorly responsible for
* To differentiate real and counterfeit images
* To generate counterfeit images that mimic training data
* To minimize the gradient
* To categorize real and counterfeit images

#####  Binary classification is used for discriminating the real and fake images 
* True
* False

#####  The limitations of GANs are 
* Overfitting of the training data
* Training instability
* Ethical concerns related to deepfake content
* All of the above

#####  The network architecture/s commonly used in GANs is
* Random Forest
* Multilayer perceptrons
* Conventional Neural Networks
* Recurrent Neural Networks
